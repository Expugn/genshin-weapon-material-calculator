# Genshin Impact - Ascension Material Calculator<br>(genshin-weapon-material-calculator)

*Previously known as "Genshin Impact - Weapon Ascension Material Calculator"*

## Information
This is just a simple calculator for figuring out if you have enough weapon ascension materials.<br>
You can see if you have enough material without having to craft or do the math yourself. That's pretty much it.

As of `October 3, 2021`, additional functionality has been added to include a calculator for talent materials. The original name, `Genshin Impact - Weapon Ascension Material Calculator` has been modified to `Genshin Impact - Ascension Material Calculator` as a result.

Seriously though why isn't this more common, why do I need to create a whole web application just to easily check if I 
have enough weapon materials without having to do the math myself. All these helper tools like <https://paimon.moe/> just tell you that you need, for example:
```
4x 5star material
9x 4star material
9x 3star material
3x 2star material
```
but if I have a random material amount like:
```
3x 5star material
4x 4star material
30x 3star material
46x 2star material
```
how am I supposed to know if I actually had enough material without crafting? Quite a shame that a calculator like this wasn't included or anything.

## Usage
1. Open the calculator URL (<https://expugn.github.io/genshin-weapon-material-calculator/>).
2. Modify the inputs below `Needed` with the amount of material you need.
3. Modify the inputs below `Owned` with the amount of material you currently have.
4. Upon modifying any input the calculator will update and tell you if you have enough material or not.
